##Introduction/Business Problem
Car accidents are among leading causes of death and injury in the industrialized world. In 2010 there were over 5.4 million car accidents in the United States, in which nearly 33,000 people died, and the numbers have risen since. It is important to state and local governments to understand the factors that lead to dangerous accidents in order to plan traffic systems to minimize the risk of accidents and allocate first responders to minimize the damage from accidents that do happen. We can use historical data on traffic accidents to create a model that predicts which conditions are the most dangerous, which we can then use to put the proper plans in place.
##Data
In this project we will use the provided dataset, which contains traffic accident statistics from the city of Seattle between January 2004 and May 2020. Potentially significant information includes the weather and lighting conditions at the time of the accident, the time of day and exact location, the nature of the collision (e.g. head-on, side-swipe from left, etc.). The incidents are also marked by whether they involved injury or only property damage (the design of the data provides for more detail, such as whether there was serious injury, death or no damage at all, but the provided dataset only contains records marked as “injury” or “only property damage”). We should be able to develop a model that allows us to predict, given environmental conditions, the nature of the accident, and certain other factors, whether an accident is likely to involve personal injury.
